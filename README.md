This repository contains Open Source Hardware Reference Designs for Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA)
that anyone can use or fabricate for themselves.

For more information, please see the [ERA Wiki](https://github.com/patternagents/ERA/wiki)!

There are many "patchable" audio synthesizers, including those from Moog, Buchla, Paia, and many more
from the 1970's and on. Most of those early systems were incompatible with each other,
using different voltage and control levels, so it was difficult to use them together.
Doepfer created the A-100 System, on which Eurorack is based, for a more open
framework where different manufacturers or designers could add modules to the
system to personalize it. Eurorack has become very popular for modular synthesizers. 

Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA) is a new, Open Source Hardware (OSHW) specification for 
Modular Audio/Video equipment that is being co-developed by a number of
cooperating companies and individuals in the audio field,
and is completely backward compatible with Eurorack (Legacy).

Eurorack has undergone some changes over the years, and one of the changes 
recommended by Dave Rossum of Rossum Electro-Music (nee Emu Systems) 
is to disconnect two of the six "Ground" signals as a circuit protection mechanism.
( see http://www.rossum-electro.com/uncategorized/circuit-protection/ )
So subtle changes have already started to be made to the Eurorack "standard", such as
other vendors reusing the Bus CV & Gate as MIDI or other proprietary signals.

In order to prevent any confusion with the Legacy Eurorack 
(either technically, or with any trademarks, etc.) 
we are refering to this new standard as the "Embedded Rack Architecture".
It is intended to be backward compatible with existing Eurorack (Legacy) systems,
however newer ERA equipment may not be able to use newer ERA features on
existing Eurorack equipment or backplanes. 


ERA is intended to be used for more than just Modular Audio/Video equipment,
and it is also used as the testing and development platform for a number of our
internal projects, as well as our manufacturing test (i.e. similar to DIN rail) systems.
