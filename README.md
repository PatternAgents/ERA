This repository contains Open Source Hardware Reference Designs for the Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA),
a new design pattern for the interconnection and packaging of Modular Audio/Video equipment.

The Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA) is a new, 
Open Source Hardware (OSHW) specification for 
Modular Audio/Video equipment that is being co-developed by a number of
cooperating companies and individuals in the audio field,
and is backward compatible with the Eurorack specification (aka Legacy Eurorack).
