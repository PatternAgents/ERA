Bus Access Module - Reference Design Embedded Rack 2.0 
-----------------------------------------------------

The Bus Access Module (BAM) is used as a passive break out board for 
ER2 backplane signals to the patchbay/front panel.
It provides a 10-Pin (0.1" spacing) single inline connector for use as a power and signal break-out
for breadboards and prototyping, as well as LED indicators for Gate and CV.
