-----------------------------------------------------
This repository contains Open Source Hardware Reference Designs for Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA)
that anyone can use or fabricate for themselves.

For more information, please see the [ERA Wiki](https://github.com/halcyonmodular/ERA/wiki)!

Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA) is a new, Open Source Hardware (OSHW) specification for 
Modular Audio/Video equipment that is being co-developed by a number of
cooperating companies and individuals in the audio field,
and is completely backward compatible with Eurorack (Legacy).
