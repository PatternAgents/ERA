A simple, passive, "Switched Multiple" design for ERA/Eurorack. 
Four(4) latching, pushbutton switches, control up to four (4) inputs,
that are routed to an internal bus.
The four inputs (P1-P4) are "normalized" to the ERA bus signals as follows:

1) ERA Bus Gate In  (Green)
2) ERA Bus CV In    (Red)
3) ERA Bus Gate Out (Blue)
4) ERA Bus CV Out   (Yellow)

When connected to an ERA backplane, those Bus signals can be routed to other
"Switched Multiple" modules, or other ERA audio/video modules.

This repository contains Open Source Hardware Reference Designs for Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA)
that anyone can use or fabricate for themselves.

Embedded Rack Architecture (ERA) is a new, Open Source Hardware (OSHW) specification for 
Modular Audio/Video equipment that is being co-developed by a number of
cooperating companies and individuals in the audio field,
and is completely backward compatible with Eurorack (Legacy).
